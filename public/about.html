<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Aditya Chaudhary! I'm a space enthusiast based in Uttar Pradesh, India. 
  My passion for space sciences started when I got to know about how amazing these stars, planets and galaxies are through a
   encyclopedia which I received when I was 9 years old and I haven't looked back since.
  About 10 year later, I am proud to say that I went through a large numbers of cosmos books, magazines, journals and articles.
  Now I have decided to create my own space enterprise and have learnt enough coding to create a website for my enterprise.
  You can now say that I have transformed myself into a web developer to fulfill my dream of becoming a space entrepreneur.</p>

<p>You know I'm a kind of creative and innovative guy who always has some plans struggling in his mind everytime. I never like
  to sit idle most probably because I believe a lot on myself and my unwavering confidence allows me to do everything whatever I choose.
  One of my biggest strength you know is my optimism towards almost every task. People say that this task cannot be done or I can't
  complete this task and a voice comes from inside of me that I can do everything in this world whatever it could be and I start 
  working harder and harder and complete that task. This gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to head for my next
  job.  
</p>

<p>You know I am writing this page for my portfolio as a web developer because obviously I need a lots of funds and skills to start a 
  space startup in my country. This web development is one of the first skills which I think I have learned with lots of enthusiasm.
 I would definitely like to thank Udemy and my curater Angela Yu for this.
  Hopefully you will love the projects that I have worked on and assign me some more sophisticated jobs to do.
</p>
<h2>Thankyou </h2>
