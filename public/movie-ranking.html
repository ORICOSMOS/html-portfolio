<h1>The Best Movies According to Aditya </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Angels and Demons</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies. An action packed mystery and thriller with lots of drama and I love the places where they have 
    shot the movie especially the national archieves of Vatican where they have preserved the original books and texts which
    were supposed to be a 1000 years old. Overall a nice movie to watch if you wanna a learn about new things and places.
   Go and watch its subsequent part 'The Vinci Code' for more entertainment. </p>
<h3>Kgf chapter 1 & 2</h3>
<p>Really cool thriller and action packed movie. What I love the most is the storyline of this movie and the badass attitude of 
    the main character. Beautifully depicts the relationship of a mother and her child. Strong message for achieving what you want and 
    the acting of main actor, supporting actors and antagonist and the superb set scenes developed by the Hombale films
    make it a must watch movie.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. The wizarding world of J.K Rowling is a sensation with Harry Potter being the protaganist.
    apart from this the character which I love is of Professor Albus Dumbledore and his affection towards Harry and muggles.
    One of the best turn around the character of Severus Snape who was like a godfather to Harry which we realised at the end of the
    series. Follow the Fantastic Beast movie series for more knowledge of the storyline.
